Password storage: 
A high-level description of the application’s “purpose”. This application will store and manage passwords for users. The site will be organized by websites for which the user can search for in a search bar. Each website will have a username and a password attached to it, which the user can access as needed. 
A high-level picture of the application’s appearance/visual design.
- Red X prompts “Are you sure you want to delete this site? All Data will be deleted”
- Must have at least a username or a password to create a card

Ideas:
- Option to update password/username
- Option to randomly generate a password
- Warning against weak passwords (use a publicly available weak passwords list)
- Hiding the password until you hover over it with cursor

A high-level overview of the data you’ll need to store to power the application.
